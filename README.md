## Description:

The ClearNPC plugin for Rust allows players to remove and restore NPCs in the game. This can be useful for server administrators and players who want to manage NPCs dynamically during gameplay. Feel free to join my Discord and choose the role Flash. I have a lot of free plugins.

*Please take care with this tool, I take no responsibility. Please consider your steps in advance and remember that there may be other NPCs with this name! If something cannot be restored, it is lost and can only be fixed with a map wipe*

## Features:

- **Remove NPCs:** Players can remove NPCs they are looking at by using a specific command.
- **Restore NPCs:** Removed NPCs can be restored to their previous state with another command.
- **Tracking Removed NPCs:** The plugin keeps track of removed NPCs, allowing for easy restoration.

## Commands:

- `/clear [npcName]` - Removes the NPC that the player is currently looking at if its name matches the provided name. The NPC's name should be specified in the command arguments.
- `/clearundo [npcName]` - Restores the last removed NPC. This command undoes the last removal action and brings the NPC back to its original position and rotation.
